## WORK EXPERIENCE
### **Coca-Cola | Atlanta, GA**  
**Senior Manager, Artificial Intelligence** (February 2025 - present)  

- ML philosophy: Start simple and add complexity only as needed. Prefer models that incorporate domain wisdom. Prefer models that are explainable. Do not believe your model until you have tested it in the hardest possible conditions.
- Expert in developing fit-for-purpose machine learning algorithms and E2E model development from data discovery to model shipping.
- **Expert in:**  
    - `Physics-informed ML`, `Graph Neural Networks`, `Cheminformatics`, `(Un)supervised Learning`, `Dimensionality Reduction`, `Clustering`, `Regression`, `Classification`.  
- **Deep knowledge of:**  
    - `RDKit`, `PyTorch`, `SymPy`, `Numpy`, `Pandas`, `Scikit-learn`, `Selenium`, `Playwright`, `BS4`, `Flask`, `D3`, `SQL`, `PyTest`, `Cypress`, `Vitest`, `Full Stack Development`.
- Experience in NLP, sentence embedding models, prompt engineering for LLM-based structured data extraction at scale.
- Developed novel algorithms for 1. predicting the color of beverage mixes 2. beverage recommendation systems 3. model validaton, and 4. model ensembling.
- Delivered process improvement via dashboard automation (35% reduction in manual time spent by VP), enhancing project efficiency and reducing error rate.
